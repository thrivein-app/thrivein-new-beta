/**
 * KretoCharacter — Kretopia's real, owned 3D character render of Kreto.
 * Confirmed team-owned asset (not a third-party reference) -- see
 * KRETO_CHARACTER_ASSET_REPORT.md. Five cropped stills from the source
 * "Meet Kreto" artwork: the main character plus four role variants
 * (Scout, Connector, Producer, Publicist).
 *
 * This is a small number of static photographic poses, not a rigged 3D
 * model -- there is exactly one pose per variant, so this component
 * cannot express different facial expressions per app state the way the
 * abstract KretoPresence can. State is instead layered on top as a small
 * signal-dot badge (same accent-dot language as KretoPresence, same
 * honesty rule: only render a non-idle badge when something real is
 * happening) plus the same paired sr-only text announcement -- state is
 * still never color/motion alone.
 *
 * "main" gets a soft radial fade (CSS mask-image) so its photographic
 * rectangle blends into the app's permanently-dark surfaces instead of
 * reading as a pasted sticker -- biased low and tall so the ground
 * shadow under its feet stays visible instead of fading with the rest
 * (direct feedback: "avec le sol sous ses pieds"). The four role
 * variants render inside a rounded-square tile, matching their own
 * presentation in the source artwork -- a defined edge is correct
 * there, not a flaw to hide.
 *
 * `hoverable` makes the cast feel alive to a real pointer, per direct
 * feedback ("comme des ballons... flotter dans l'air"): idle motion
 * drifts on both axes like a buoyant balloon, and a real hover knocks
 * the character to a random nearby spot with a springy, elastic
 * transition, settling back into its own drift once the pointer
 * leaves -- off by default everywhere else.
