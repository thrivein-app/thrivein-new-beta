/**
 * LandingBelowFold — everything on the landing page after the hero.
 *
 * Split into its own chunk and mounted only once the visitor approaches it
 * (or the browser goes idle), so the hero stays on the critical path and
 * becomes interactive as early as possible.
 *
 * Every chapter follows one structural pattern: image (or illustrative
 * visual) → numbered title → explanation → an interactive tutorial
 * immediately below it. Numbers come from chapterRegistry.ts — the single
 * source of truth also used by ChapterProgressNav — so removing, adding,
 * or reordering a chapter here never requires hand-patching a number
 * anywhere else.
